  - quote: We are originally from Australia so I was looking for some properties online in the US and I sent out some emails to different Realtors. Dave Sunzeri with Brett Jennings Real Estate Experts was one of the first to follow up with me and schedule a meeting to sit down and talk about what he could do for us. Dave was definitely the most proactive in getting back to us and he just made the whole thing an easy process. Dave met with us the second day after we arrived in the US! Because we were moving from another country, we didn’t’ know a lot about the real estate industry or how Realtors even operated. Dave sat down and talked with us about how everything worked and we really appreciated it. When we were looking at properties he pointed out issues that we may not have noticed and he really made sure that we got the right house for us. You can basically hand the process over to him and he’ll be looking after your interests without a doubt.

  - quote: We really liked working with Brett Jennings and his team. It’s such a professional environment! He has people that specifically take care of certain aspects of the process from sales to leasing. It’s just excellent, efficient service.

His professional team takes care of every detail of the operation! Brett is just professional, reliable, and exceeds all expectations. You can trust him and his team 100%.

  - quote: Brett was very attentive to my needs and offered me the services I was looking for. He took care of every detail which made everything flow smoothly. I was impressed with how he handled himself. Anytime we had an appointment he was always there on time so I think he was very professional and businesslike. I was looking for a quick sale, and he found a cash buyer that enabled me to sell my property quickly with very little hassle. I would refer him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.

  - quote: About a year ago, we decided we wanted to start getting an idea of how things would go if we sold our house. We actually met with a different realtor and decided that we did not care for her. Brett happened to call us when we were getting more serious about selling our home and we decided to meet with him. Brett and his team came over and talked it through with us and we all just hit it off right away. We always felt very comfortable with them. I haven’t had a lot of experience selling a home so I was freaking out a lot but the team was able to ease any concerns I had. They were very helpful. Brett and his team were more willing to listen to what we wanted versus telling us what we should do and they were not pushy at all. I didn’t have any problems with them at all. He ended up getting us $15,000 more than identical homes selling in the neighborhood. I would refer them to anyone.

  - quote: Being new to the area, I had asked a friend for a recommendation for an agent. My friend told me that Brett was the person to see so I gave him a try and I’m really glad I did. It was a great experience. I didn’t have to ask many questions because Brett was very good at explaining everything right the first time. Brett is very personable and everything was done exactly right. He really knows the business and he is very thorough. He’s a great negotiator, and I got some really good buys which was very helpful as far as saving money. I’ve actually gone back to him and have done a couple of different homes with him. I would recommend him in a minute!

  - quote: We had been talking with another real estate agent before but we didn’t feel that she was aggressive enough for what we wanted so we did not go back to her. We met with Brett and had a really good first impression. He was prepared and seemed to have quite a few connections that would make it possible to flip a house. After our first meeting I did some research on him and saw that he had a really good online presence. In working with Brett, I found that he was able to provide a lot of resources that made it so easy for me because I did not have to go about managing a lot of different people and do it on my own. We were able to get $15,000 more than we expected. I would absolutely recommend him.

  - quote: I had gotten to know Brett through some seminars I had attended and I was just impressed with him as a person so when I needed someone, I went straight to him. As an agent, I was really impressed with how he handled every single aspect of the whole process. Brett made things really easy for me especially since I had to travel. If there were documents I had to sign, they were sent to me wherever I was. There were a few glitches in selling my home but I never really felt them. I didn’t have to worry about anything and things just got done because he was on top of it. He was very calm which made me feel calm. He gave off total confidence that we were going to get through any problem we came across. I would feel comfortable referring anyone to Brett and his team because I know that they’ll get the same experience and service that I had.

  - quote: When I first met Brett, I felt very comfortable with him. Even in that initial meeting, I thought that he could do a good job for me and he really did. He sold my house in 12 days, and got me $16,000 more than we expected. Throughout the process he was able to solve any problems we had fairly quickly. Brett was really on top of it especially when there was something that needed to be done. I would definitely refer him!

  - quote: We had actually first heard about Brett Jennings because he had called us to see if we knew anyone who was interested in selling their home. It just so happened that we were interested so we called him back. Brett came and looked at the property and already had an outline of his selling approach. We took the approach and talked it over with some other people and they confirmed that Brett’s approach was the best way to go. Brett managed the process and supported all the various steps and we got a good price for the house. We were very satisfied with the whole outcome! Our home was on the market for about 14 days. The thing that impressed me the most about Brett was the way he assembled his team around him. He was able to address any issues along the way and managed everything very smoothly. I had high expectations to begin with and he met them all!

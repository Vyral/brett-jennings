Are you a buyer waiting for prices to finally drop, or a seller asking why your home is sitting longer on the market? These are the two biggest questions in Silicon Valley real estate at the moment. With mortgage rates easing, the stock market hitting record highs, and inventory climbing to five-year peaks, the answers aren’t simple, but understanding how supply, demand, interest rates, and the stock market all interact will help you get the full picture.

Currently, mortgage rates are decreasing, which is improving affordability for buyers. At the same time, the stock market is hitting all-time highs, creating a wealth effect for tech employees whose compensation is tied to equity.

On the supply side, inventory has climbed to near five-year highs, giving buyers homes to choose from. With the Federal Reserve signaling a possible long-term shift away from rate hikes, we may be seeing the early stages of a meaningful trend change.

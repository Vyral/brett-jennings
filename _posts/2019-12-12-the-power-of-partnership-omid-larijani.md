Omid Larijani here. I’m with Brett Jennings today and we have some exciting news for you\! As many of you know, I earned my real estate licensed in 2006 but recently **I sought out one of the best real estate teams in Silicon Valley, Brett Jennings and Real Estate Experts,** to help advance my career.&nbsp;

For those who haven’t followed my career, I began on the loan side of the business but it wasn’t until last year that I decided to take the next step and become a real estate agent and broker. I had enormous success as an agent in my first year and helped nearly 20 families find a home, which put me in the top 5% of all agents in the county. As I spoke with Brett, I realized I not only wanted to help more families, but I also wanted to do it even better.&nbsp;

Brett knew I was dedicated to my clients and looked at his business where **they offer excellent systems and over 100 years of expertise** amongst the team members, and we both realized we could serve our clients at a higher level.

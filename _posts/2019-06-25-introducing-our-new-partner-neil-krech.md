Today, allow me to introduce you all to Neil Krech, who is no longer just my mentee, but also my official business partner\! I’m so excited to have him as a member of our team and to watch as he helps us take the business to the next level.

Neil launched his real estate career last year in Seattle, and in his first year out of the gate, he helped over 20 families either buy or sell real estate. **The average Realtor does about four or five transactions in their first year, so it’s clear that we have a superstar on our hands.**

An awesome real estate professional is one who is dedicated to serving their clients at the highest level possible, and in partnering with Neil and his standards for serving clients and leveraging our systems and reach, we know that we can help out even more people in the ways they deserve.

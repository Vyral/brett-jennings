I'm here with Brett Jennings from the Real Estate Experts, and I have some exciting news to share. After nine years in the real estate business, I wanted to expand my services for clients.

With a background in interior design and construction, including owning a restaurant, I bring a unique skill set to real estate. **However, I realized I wanted to do more without compromising service quality as a solo agent.** So, Brett and I decided to partner up.

In the coming weeks, I'll share success stories and market updates, so look out for them! I'm excited about 2024 and eager to assist with buying, selling, investing, or remodeling. Let's create a better life through real estate; call or email us anytime!

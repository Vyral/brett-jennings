Switching careers can be quite a challenge, but sometimes, it leads to unexpected joy and fulfillment. This is a story of leaving my old job behind and entering the world of real estate. I never imagined how much I would love it.

I moved to the Bay Area in 1996 to get my master's in Fine Arts. **Through my journey, I ended up in hospitality, spending 10 years traveling to some of the best cities in the U.S. This experience gave me a unique perspective on people, places, and what they seek in their lifestyles.** Then, about five years ago, I decided to enter real estate.

I’ve lived in the Bay Area for a total of 26 years now, and I absolutely love it here. The diverse neighborhoods offer something for everyone, fitting every lifestyle choice. I’m really passionate about that.

For those of you who aren’t familiar with my career in real estate, I have achieved amazing things in just five years. **In one year alone, I sold over $20 million in real estate, which had me placed in the top 10% of all real estate agents throughout the Bay Area.**

As you know, the Bay Area has many unique micro-communities. Every home is unique, like a snowflake, and accurate valuation needs more than just numbers. With my experience working with families and friends across Monterey to Sonoma County, I truly understand these neighborhoods. It’s important to have someone who has lived here and really understands the lifestyle people in the Bay Area want.

In the coming weeks and months, I will continue to share success stories of families I’ve helped, as well as market updates to keep you informed about Bay Area real estate. Whether you’re just considering a move or ready to make that jump, reach out to me. We can chat over coffee or a cocktail—just call me.

I'm your gal. Until next time, this is Audrey and Brett, ready to help you create a better life through real estate. Have a great day!<br><br>[**Home Search**](https://realestateexperts.ruuster.com/agent/ani-gregorians-beddow){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}<br><br>[**Home Value**](https://get.homebot.ai/?id=a29cac3b-4d4d-41da-8afd-7656856dbd4b){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

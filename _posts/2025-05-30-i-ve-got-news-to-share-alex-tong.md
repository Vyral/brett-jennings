I’m excited to share a new chapter in my real estate journey. After several years of working alongside my family in our brokerage, I’ve made the decision to join Real Estate Experts. This move is about expanding my reach, helping more families, and delivering an even higher level of service backed by a forward-thinking, tech-driven team.

Real estate has always been a part of my life. With over 20 years of experience in my family, I’ve spent the last few years learning from the ground up, focusing on integrity, results, and genuine service. As I looked to grow and scale that impact, I knew I needed the right environment and support. That’s why joining Real Estate Experts felt like the right fit—aligned values, shared commitment to innovation, and a strong vision for what’s possible.

Now that I’m part of the team, we’ve added new tools to support you even better. Buyers can now explore the full Bay Area MLS directly through the Search for Homes tab. For sellers, the Find My Home Value tool gives you a quick, instant estimate of your property’s worth. While that’s a great place to start, I’ll help you fine-tune that number using real market data and insights based on local trends and upgrades.

In the coming months, I’ll be sharing updates on the families I’ve worked with, market trends to watch, and tips to help you stay ahead. My goal is to be a reliable resource and advisor, whether you’re buying, selling, or simply exploring your options.<br><br>If you have questions about the market or would like to discuss your goals, I’m here to help. You can call me at 415-519-8630 or send an email to [**alex@therealexperts.com**](alex@therealexperts.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>[**Home Value**](https://get.homebot.ai/?id=d2fe4aba-c761-4c1d-a6de-26949076f103){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}<br><br>[**Home Search**](https://realestateexperts.ruuster.com/agent/alex-tong){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

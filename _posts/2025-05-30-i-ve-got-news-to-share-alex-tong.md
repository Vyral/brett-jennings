I’m excited to share some news that reflects our continued growth and commitment to delivering exceptional real estate experiences. Alex Tong, a dedicated agent with deep roots in real estate, has officially joined our team at Real Estate Experts. After spending several years working alongside his family in their brokerage, Alex made the decision to partner with us to help more families and bring an elevated level of service to his clients.

For those who don’t know, **Alex comes from a family with over 20 years of real estate experience.** He’s spent the last few years working with his mother and building a strong foundation based on integrity, service, and results. When he came to me, he shared his vision for expanding his impact, helping more clients, and delivering a more modern, tech-forward experience. That shared commitment to innovation and service made this partnership a natural fit.

**With Alex on board, we’re bringing more tools to the table.** If you’re buying, you now have access to the full Bay Area MLS through the Search for Homes tab, making it easy to browse every listing across the region. And if you’re selling, the Find My Home Value tab offers an instant estimate of your property’s worth. While that’s a great starting point, Alex and I know from experience that no algorithm can match the insight of a local expert. We’ll help you fine-tune that value based on upgrades, neighborhood trends, and current market data.

Over the next few months, Alex will also be sharing stories from the families he’s helped, along with local market updates to keep you informed and ahead of the curve. His energy and dedication are already making a difference, and I know our clients will benefit from his perspective.

If you’re thinking about buying, selling, or investing, Alex Tong is ready to help. I’m proud to have him on our team and excited for what’s ahead. If you have questions or need guidance, you can contact me at **408-596-4490** or send an email to [Brett@TheRealExperts.com](mailto:Brett@TheRealExperts.com). We’re here to help.<br><br>**Home Value**<br><br>**Home Search**

I’m here today with Brett Jennings of the Real Estate Experts to share some exciting news. I’ve owned and operated Journey Real Estate for a little over a year, and as we have continued to grow, I noticed I was getting short on systems and processes that I needed to fully serve my clients. That’s why I’m excited to announce that Journey Real Estate will now be powered by Brett and Real Estate Experts. This partnership will allow me to provide an even higher level of service to my clients with their systems and support. To learn more about the merger, watch this short video.

Hello, everyone! Kathy Thai here, and I am so excited to announce that I am taking the next step in the evolution of my business. Taking a big leap of faith, I have decided to join Real Estate Experts and Brett Jennings.

In the four years I’ve been in real estate, I’ve had the opportunity to accomplish so much. **In one year alone, I helped over 14 families and sold over $20 million in real estate.** This puts me in the top 5% of Realtors in Silicon Valley.

I love real estate, and I don’t want to compromise on the customer service and support that I provide, which is what makes the Brett Jennings team such a perfect fit. They have outstanding systems and resources available that I can start sharing with you today.

You can now search for homes right from our website or even get a free estimate of your home’s value just by entering some basic information.

But that’s just the start. For an even more accurate assessment of your home’s value, you need a real estate expert like me in your corner. In the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing stories of the families I’ve been privileged to help every month, as well as market updates and answers to your burning questions.

So send me your questions! Be sure to reach out by phone or email for any of your real estate needs, whether it is buying, selling, or investing. I’m here to be your real estate expert.<br><br>[**Home Value**](https://get.homebot.ai/?id=ccb3a4e6-b5c1-4680-bbd8-7281d8f2e0a5){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}<br><br>[**Home Search**](https://realestateexperts.ruuster.com/agent/kathy-tai){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

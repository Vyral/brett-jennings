Today I’m back with the fourth installment into our series on how you can sell your home for 18% more money. I know this sounds like a bold claim, but it’s true.

In previous episodes we talked about preparing, presenting, and pricing your home. This time we’ll be talking about the importance of marketing.

Marketing controls how many people see the home, both online and in person, and this exposure is what will dictate what the property sells for. To achieve optimal results, there are four main areas of marketing you must focus on:

**1. Local marketing.** This involves placing your property on the local MLS, which is syndicated to over 200 different websites.

**2. National marketing.** Silicon Valley is a major relocation destination, so marketing your listing across the country could help you capture an out-of-state buyer. Websites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com will be some of your best resources in gaining national exposure. Our team allocates a lot of our marketing expenses into making sure our clients’ listings appear at the top of online searches.

**3. International marketing.** 31% of all property purchases in our state are either foreign or foreign-born. Therefore, it’s important not to miss out on this segment of the market. Our team has partnered with Proxio, a platform that allows us to connect and engage with over 100 different countries using 82 different websites.

**4. Social media marketing.** The internet is an incredible tool. In fact, Facebook could bring you nearly twice the exposure you’d get on Zillow.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

How can you find the right agent when selling your home? There are four key criteria that you should look out for:

**1\. How much experience do they have?** Did you know that 90% of home sales are done by 10% of the available real estate agents? Fortunately in today’s market, we do have an online resource that provides transparency to consumers: Zillow. You can see how many home sales an agent has done, figure out who’s doing business by looking at their activity, and find out what it’s like to work with an agent by reading their reviews. From there, pick two to three agents to interview.

**2\. What are their specific skills and training?** Selling a home is a lot different than buying a home and requires a completely different skill set. You should also make sure that your agent has experience in home improvement. Homes that are prepared and updated for the market are selling for 5% to 7% more money than homes that aren’t. An agent with home improvement experience can tell you where to put money into your house in order to get the most money possible out of your home sale.

Online marketing skills are also incredibly important. These days, 98% of buyers start their home search online. The price your home sells for is a function of how many people see it online and how many of those come to see it in person.

Finally, make sure your agent has great negotiation skills. Have they been trained in negotiation? Our agents are all certified negotiators. We also have one of the most innovative real estate teams in the country when it comes to online marketing, and about 75% of our clients have us help them during home renovations.

**3\. Does the agent have deep resources?** Preparing a home for sale can be a big job. You may need to get carpeting cleaned or replaced, update the kitchen, or take care of other home improvements. You need to hire someone with a team of resources to take a lot of that work off your plate. Hire someone who can put you in touch with a great mover as well.

**4\. Hire someone you feel comfortable with.** Selling a home can be stressful. Selling also takes longer than buying a home. Buying a home usually takes about 30 days. Selling can be a 90-day process, so hire an agent that has a great personality. It’s important that you feel comfortable working with this agent for the next two to three months.

**1. Pay attention to the mover's reputation.** Do your research. Read customer reviews, and make sure everyone that you allow into your home is on the up and up.

**2. Make sure the company has workers' compensation insurance.** This ensures that if someone gets injured on the job, the company will not sue the homeowners.

**3. The mover should care.** You want them to care for the home and the goods they are moving.

**With Ace Relocation, the home itself will be protected by rug and hardwood floor covers, and everything will be wrapped appropriately.** Anything that's breakable will be covered first with cardboard, then pad-wrapped, and then shrink-wrapped.

That's why we recommend Scott Cramer and Ace Relocation to all of our clients. Ace Relocation is a great moving company. To contact Scott, call (408) 605-7412 or email SCramer@AceRelocation.com.

As always, if you have any questions for us, give us a call or send us an email. We'd be happy to help you.

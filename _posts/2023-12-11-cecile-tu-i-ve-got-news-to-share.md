Cecile Tu, with 21 years of experience in the real estate industry, is determined to take her business to new heights. Seeking guidance, she turned to me for collaboration.

**Recognized for her two-decade tenure in real estate, Cecile has aided numerous families in buying and selling properties across the Bay Area.** Her commitment to maintaining high-quality service while expanding her reach led to a partnership with our team, leveraging our robust systems and unwavering support to extend her services to more families.

Initiating this joint endeavor, we offer options for potential clients: Click on the Search for Homes tab for access to Silicon Valley and Bay Area MLS listings if you’re a prospective buyer. If you’re a seller, clicking on the Find My Home Value tab provides an instant estimate, recognizing the need for adjustments for precise valuations beyond online estimates.

**While platforms like Redfin and Zillow can give you rough estimates, working with real estate professionals is still the best way to determine accurate property valuations.** Furthermore, we plan to share success stories of families Cecile has helped and provide market updates on Bay Area real estate in the coming weeks and months.

Cecile emphasizes her availability to assist in property transactions or enhancements. Whether you’re buying, selling, or making upgrades, feel free to reach out to her for real estate support.

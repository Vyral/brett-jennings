Why did our new partner Lin-Lin Otani decide to join Real Estate Experts? We’ll let her explain it.&nbsp;

“After closing over $114 million in home sales, I have discovered that it was crucial to offer top-notch service to my clients without restrictions. In this bifurcated market, it was important to identify a team with prudent success strategies for getting the best results for their clients. After much consideration and offers to join top teams in the area, I’ve selected the Real Estate Experts due to their client care team being in the top 3% under Bret Jennings’ amazing guidance.”

In case you didn’t know, **in just seven short years, Lin Lin has elevated herself to the top 5% of all agents throughout Silicon Valley.** I founded Real Estate Experts to help exceptional agents like Lin-Lin elevate and grow their business without sacrificing the level of service they provide. Through best-in-class technology, amazing client support, and expert-level negotiation, we create award-winning results.&nbsp;

“Everyone has a story to tell,” Lin-Lin says. “I would like to be a part of your success story in your home selling and/or buying process.”

**If your goals for 2020 include buying or selling real estate, we want to be a part of that story.** To start, we have plenty of free resources to offer you. If you’re a buyer, you can click on our “home search” tab for gateway access to the MLS and all the homes available in Silicon Valley.

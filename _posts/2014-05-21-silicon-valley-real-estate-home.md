Our topic today comes to us from people asking about the recent increase in home values throughout California and Silicon Valley. I wanted to show you 5 different ways that you can increase your home's value through home improvements.

**1. Front Door:** You never get a second chance to make a first impression. A new front door can cost anywhere from $700-$5,000 but on average, you can expect a 125% return on the replacement of a front door.

**2. Interior Doors:** Interior doors are relatively inexpensive but can add a lot to your home. There is a company in Silicon Valley (Interior Door Replacement Company) that can replace your doors for $100-$200. This is a very inexpensive way to upgrade the look of your home. It's amazing what new door handles can do as well.

**3. Garage Door:** This will typically increase your home value and your curb appeal substantially. I recently replaced my aluminum garage door with a wooden one, and it made a world of difference on the curb appeal of my home. This is another project that will return well over 100% of the money invested.

**4. Kitchen Remodel:** While this is more extensive than my other suggestions, kitchens sell houses. A kitchen remodel can dramatically upgrade the appeal (and market value) of your home. In my opinion, a good kitchen remodel can return 2-3x the cost, making it one of the best investments you can make in your home.

**5. Bathroom Remodels:** Bathroom and kitchen remodels go hand in hand. Consumers love seeing updated kitchens and modern bathrooms. You can spend as little as $3,000 dollars on a half bathroom, or you can spend as much as $15,000 on a full bathroom remodel. Little changes to your bathroom can also add a lot of value.

If you're considering a specific project for your Silicon Valley home, be sure to look at that report and also consult with a professional real estate agent. **Most remodels don't raise your home's value and will cost you both time and money. A local real estate expert can help you determine where your home would benefit the most from key improvements.**

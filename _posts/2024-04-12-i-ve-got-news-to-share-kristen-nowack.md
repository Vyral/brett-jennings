Today, I’ll share with you some exciting news! Let’s welcome the newest addition to Brett Jenning’s team, Kristen Nowack. After two decades in the real estate industry, Kristen made the decision to take her business to the next level by joining the team. **She believes that the team has well-implemented systems and processes that will be beneficial not only to her but to her clients as well** when it comes to buying and selling homes in the Bay Area.

The Bay Area real estate market has a lot of complexities, but Kristen’s 20 years of experience assisting countless families places her in the top 10% of real estate agents in the region.

Because of this, we are confident that our partnership is the way forward, starting by offering you some valuable resources. If you’re considering buying a home, **simply click on the “Search for Homes” tab to access our MLS and browse through all available homes** in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.

On the other hand, if you are planning to sell, click on “Find My Home Value” for an instant estimate of your home’s value, though keep in mind that these estimates are not final and may benefit from expert insight. We are dedicated to guiding you through the intricacies of floor plans, functionality upgrades, and location nuance to ensure that you get an accurate understanding of your home’s value.

In the coming weeks and months, Kristen will be sharing success stories and market updates to keep you informed about the latest developments in Bay Area real estate.

If you have questions or are ready to start your buying or selling journey, reach out to me by phone or email. I am available seven days a week to assist you. Together with Kristen, your go-to gal for all things real estate, and the rest of the team, we are here to help you create a better life through real estate.<br><br>[**Home Search**](https://realestateexperts.ruuster.com/agent/kristen-nowack){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}<br><br>[**Home Value**](https://get.homebot.ai/?id=515fb202-acd6-480f-bc88-9a76a6aedbf3){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

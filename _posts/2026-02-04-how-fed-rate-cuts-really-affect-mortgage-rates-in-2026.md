Have you been watching the news, hoping the Fed’s latest move will drop mortgage rates? I get it, that’s what everyone assumes, but in 2026, mortgage rates don’t work that way.

They don’t automatically follow the Fed’s decisions, and waiting or trying to time the market could mean missing your best opportunity.

**Why do people think mortgage rates will drop?** I see it all the time. Many buyers and homeowners assume that when the Fed cuts rates, mortgage rates fall right away. On the surface, it makes sense. But in reality, mortgage rates move on a different path. They are influenced by bigger market forces, not just what the Fed does.

Here’s what you need to understand about how mortgage rates really work and why a Fed rate cut doesn’t always mean lower payments for you.

**1\. The Fed doesn’t directly control mortgage rates.** Here’s the deal. The Fed sets the federal funds rate, which affects short-term lending between banks. Mortgage rates, however, are tied to the bond market, specifically the 10-year Treasury yield.

When investors feel confident, yields can drop, and mortgage rates often follow. But when inflation is high or economic signals are mixed, rates can stay elevated. So even though the Fed recently cut rates, mortgage lenders aren’t simply following Jerome Powell. They’re watching bigger market forces, and that has a bigger impact on your mortgage rate.

**2\. Mortgage rates react to market expectations, not just news.** Another thing most people don’t realize is that mortgage rates respond to market expectations, not just headlines. Investors set rates based on what they expect to happen in the economy, not just on current events.

For example, if markets expect inflation to remain high or the job market to stay strong, rates might remain unchanged or even rise. This means the Fed can cut rates, but mortgage rates might not move if the bond market doesn’t respond.

**3\. The impact won’t happen overnight.** So, can this Fed rate cut help mortgage rates fall later in 2026? Yes, it’s possible. But it’s not instant. For rates to really move, we would need consistent inflationary improvement, weaker economic data, or shifts in investor confidence.

A single announcement alone usually isn’t enough to create a big drop in mortgage rates. If you’re waiting for rates to crash, that moment might not come exactly when you expect.

Buying, refinancing, or watching the market? Here’s the takeaway: mortgage rates don’t move in lockstep with Fed policy. Pay attention to where rates are now and how they affect your numbers, not just Fed announcements.

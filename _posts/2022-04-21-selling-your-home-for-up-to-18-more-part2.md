Welcome back to part two of my series about how to sell your home for up to 18% more money. I know that sounds like a bold claim, but we’ll prove it’s possible by walking you through our process.

Last time, we talked about preparing the home for sale. Once it’s prepared, it’s now about presenting your home to the market. How do we do that?

The first thing to do is stage the home. If you have nice furniture, we might leave most or all of it in the home to show. Otherwise, we’ll bring in furniture that will showcase the home to look amazing online. We know that how your home shows online is the new curb appeal, that **staged homes will sell for 2% to 3% more money,** and that 95% of staged homes will sell within 14 days.

Secondly, once we’ve staged the home, we want to capture it in photo and video. Specifically, we want to use twilight photography to showcase your home. Why? Well, our marketing statistics show that photographing in twilight will not only make the home show well in nice lighting, but also that most other homes online aren’t doing twilight photography. **We found that we get 200% to 300% more clicks using twilight photos than daylight photos.** Ultimately, the price you get for your home is going to be a function of how many people see it online and click through the photos. That will determine how many offers you get down the road.

You also want to capture your home on video, which provides a perspective that still photos can’t provide. **Video is the most frequently used medium with consumers on mobile devices.** 70% of people are watching videos on their phones.

In addition, video enables us to nearly double your exposure by getting into one of the best marketing mediums—Facebook. We get thousands, if not tens of thousands, of views of our Facebook videos.

Finally, the last thing we do is capture the home using a technology called **Matterport.** This is effectively like a Google Streetview for you home, and you can view anywhere in and around the home, looking both up and down. **Viewers can get a sense of what it’s like to be inside that home. It’s the next best thing to being there.**

With Matterport’s newest technology, they even incorporate virtual reality. If someone has Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, they can take their iPhone and see the home in 3-D as if they were walking through it.

By using these techniques to present your home to market, we can get 200% to 300% more buyers to see your home, which ultimately drives up the price.

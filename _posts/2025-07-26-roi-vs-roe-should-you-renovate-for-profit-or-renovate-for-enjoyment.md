Deciding whether to renovate now or wait until you sell isn’t easy. Homeowners often weigh the desire for an upgraded space against concerns about recouping costs. However, the key here is to know your goal. Are you seeking ROI or simply a better home experience? Let your goals and timeline guide you. Here’s everything you need to know:<br><br>**1\. Renovating for ROI**. Focus on changes that boost resale value, like kitchens, bathrooms, and curb appeal. These upgrades often yield the best financial return, but stick to broadly appealing designs and avoid overspending. A thoughtful kitchen remodel, for example, can double its cost in value if planned well. If profit is the main aim, prioritize market appeal and cost control.

**2\. Renovating for enjoymen**t. Not all renovations need to be about resale. Some updates are simply about making your daily life better. This is where the concept of return on enjoyment comes in. A peaceful bathroom, an open kitchen for family dinners, or a cozy home office can make a real difference in how you experience your space. These updates may still add value when you eventually sell, but their main benefit is how they improve your current lifestyle. If you plan to stay in your home for one to three more years or longer, designing for personal comfort and joy may be the better choice.

**3\. Decide whether it’s worth it**. If you are still unsure which path to take, start by listing the updates that would improve your daily life right now. Then, consult with a real estate expert who can help identify which of those changes might also support the future resale value of your home. This approach allows you to prioritize renovations that serve both your current needs and your long-term goals. It is not always a matter of choosing one or the other. In many cases, it is possible to achieve both return on enjoyment and return on investment with the right plan.

There is no single answer to the question of whether to renovate now or wait. The best decision depends on your personal timeline, goals, and the condition of your home. If you need help evaluating your options or want recommendations for trusted contractors, reach out for a professional assessment based on your home and local market.

As a real estate agent, one of the most common questions I get from potential home sellers is, “When is the best time of year to sell my home?”

The 30-year mortgage rate is close to 7%, a big jump from the low 6% range earlier this year. Rates rose sharply in October, slowing sales, but there’s good news ahead. **The Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates gradually in 2025, potentially bringing rates back into the low sixes.** While rates won’t drop significantly, buyers and sellers should prepare for increased activity once they do.

**If you’re a buyer, now is a great time to act.** Winter is quieter, meaning less competition, but inventory is low, so waiting could mean missing out. This is also a good time to list if you’re a seller. There’s less competition with near-record-low inventory, and buyers are motivated, especially for well-priced, move-in-ready homes.

The new year brings exciting opportunities. Lower rates, increased sales, and a tech-driven boom fueled by AI are expected to drive continued price growth.

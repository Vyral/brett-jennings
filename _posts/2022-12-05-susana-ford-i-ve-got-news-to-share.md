After working in events and entertainment for 10 years, I am excited to announce that I am transitioning back into real estate\! I used to work in commercial real estate, but I missed working with people, so now Iâ€™ll be working in residential. I am partnering with a great organization to do this, and their support has been amazing. To hear about my journey and how I can help you, watch this short video.

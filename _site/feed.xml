        <title>Can Facebook Help You Sell Your Home?</title>

&lt;p&gt;If used correctly, Facebook can be an amazing marketing tool for today’s home sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the age of the internet, there are many online resources that can help people sell their homes—but what about Facebook? Can Facebook help you sell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, yes. Using a targeted approach, Facebook can allow sellers to double their exposure online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;ask yourself who the ideal buyer for your property is.&lt;/strong&gt; Defining the profile of your ideal buyer will help you determine what your “avatar” is and how you can market to them. In this case, the term  “avatar” means your target buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have this avatar in mind, it’s time to &lt;strong&gt;film and post video footage of your home.&lt;/strong&gt; Videos get the highest level of engagement on Facebook, and are also the most highly prioritized in terms of where they appear on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=USING A TARGETED APPROACH, FACEBOOK CAN ALLOW SELLERS TO DOUBLE THEIR EXPOSURE ONLINE.%20http://localhost:4000/can-facebook-help-you-sell-your-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“USING A TARGETED APPROACH, FACEBOOK CAN ALLOW SELLERS TO DOUBLE THEIR EXPOSURE ONLINE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third step in leveraging this platform to gain exposure for your listing is to &lt;strong&gt;pay for Facebook ads.&lt;/strong&gt; Using Facebook advertising to reach your specific, ideal buyer can vastly increase the amount of attention your listing receives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is such an effective real estate marketing tool that our team was recently interviewed by The Wall Street Journal regarding this tactic. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-real-estate-uses-big-data-to-track-clients-1431615728&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see the full article here&lt;/a&gt;, but to summarize what we revealed during the interview, &lt;strong&gt;our team was once able to sell a client’s home for $125,000 more than the next-highest offer by using Facebook in our marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: Using Facebook as a tool to help sell your home can be massively effective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Has The Silicon Valley Market Hit Its Peak?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pms1tc1LJ1w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been wondering if the Silicon Valley real estate market has peaked. Today we’re taking a closer look to determine whether that’s the case or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Considering Buying? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconvalleyrealestatesearch.com/?utm_source=BLOG&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Video+Blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here for gateway access to MLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Silicon Valley home prices up by 25% this year already, many area property owners are wondering whether prices can go higher or the market has hit its peak. I’ve got a fall market update for you today that will answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To understand where this market is headed, we have to understand what’s been driving it up in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt; Real estate is a supply-and-demand driven market, but there is an affordability ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most real estate markets around the country, a balanced inventory means we have about six months of supply. This means that if no other homes came on the market, all the available homes would be bought in six months. &lt;strong&gt;Right now in Silicon Valley, we have only six weeks of inventory available,&lt;/strong&gt; which is actually up 50% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s keeping our inventory constrained? &lt;strong&gt;A few different things.&lt;/strong&gt; First, retirees aren’t moving. In fact, 87% of retirees are staying in their current homes as opposed to relocating or downsizing. Another factor is move-up buyers. Buyers who purchased their home five to 10 years ago and want to purchase a larger home now are facing the prospect of a property tax bill that is double or triple what they’re currently paying. For that reason, these would-be sellers are deciding to remodel or expand instead. Lastly, anyone who has bought a house in the last five years likely has a very low interest rate. If they decide to buy, they will see their interest rate increase almost by 50%. Many are choosing to remodel or expand their current properties, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=HOME PRICES ARE RISING FASTER THAN WAGES ARE.%20http://localhost:4000/has-silicon-valley-market-hit-its-peak.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“HOME PRICES ARE RISING FASTER THAN WAGES ARE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What drives demand in real estate? Jobs. In Silicon Valley, there are plenty of them. Last year, 47,000 new jobs were created and 22,000 people moved here. The real issue is that only 12,000 new housing permits were issued, mostly for condos and apartments. &lt;strong&gt;As you can see, we have a low supply and high demand, which has driven the market higher.&lt;/strong&gt; You would think there would be no end in sight, but buyers can only stretch so far, which goes back to the affordability ceiling I discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As higher and higher paid workers chase higher and higher priced homes, we get to a point where house prices are going up faster than wages. No matter where you work, you probably didn’t get a 25% raise this year to keep pace with home prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;59% of tech workers surveyed said they couldn’t afford the house they live in with today’s prices and interest rates. &lt;strong&gt;Only 34% of first-time buyers entering this market can afford to buy a home right now.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that our market hit its peak this summer. We’ve seen prices come off the top by about 6% since this June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a home seller, it’s a great time to list. Prices are still near all-time highs. If you’re a buyer, inventory is opening up and prices are down a bit. There’s a great window for you to come in and buy your dream home. Either way, the time to buy or sell is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the market or want to discuss your buying or selling plans further, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Qualities of an Exceptional Buying Agent</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUfz2CG9eqY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a real estate representative for your next home purchase, there are four qualities to look for if you want to hire the best possible agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Considering Buying? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconvalleyrealestatesearch.com/?utm_source=BLOG&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Video+Blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here for gateway access to MLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Considering Selling? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconvalleyrealestatesearch.com/home-valuation/?utm_source=VYRAL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Vyral+Emails+&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here for a FREE Home Price Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siliconvalleyrealestatesearch.com/off-market-list/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here to access off-site properties&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes time to buy a new home, how can you be sure that the agent you’ve hired is well-suited for the job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four key qualities to look for when evaluating an agent’s fitness for your transaction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How much experience does the agent have?&lt;/strong&gt; About 90% of the homes in our market are sold by about 10% of the active agents within it. What’s more is that the average agent only sells between three and five homes every year. A truly experienced agent will be much more active than this. Find someone who is not only very active, but is also providing quality service to their clients. Zillow is a great resource for finding active agents—they have profiles set up on the website, and clients can leave reviews for you to look at. You can even check out our Zillow profile by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/profile/BrettJenningsTeam/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. On average, agents on our team typically sell between 18 and 30 homes a year—five times the number of the average agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What negotiation skills does the agent have?&lt;/strong&gt; Most brokerages provide contract training, but training on negotiation isn’t as typical. However, negotiation skills are extremely important, since it’s through negotiation that you can determine how much equity you’ll end up with at the end of your transaction. Everyone on our team is a certified negotiation expert, all taught with the same curriculum used at Harvard Law. We’re very effective in getting our clients homes for the lowest possible price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=EVERYONE ON OUR TEAM IS A CERTIFIED NEGOTIATION EXPERT, ALL TAUGHT WITH THE SAME CURRICULUM USED AT HARVARD LAW.%20http://localhost:4000/what-qualities-do-top-agents-have.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“EVERYONE ON OUR TEAM IS A CERTIFIED NEGOTIATION EXPERT, ALL TAUGHT WITH THE SAME CURRICULUM USED AT HARVARD LAW.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What resources does the agent have?&lt;/strong&gt; A good buyer’s representative will offer you some off-market properties in addition to what can be found on the MLS. Almost 25% of the transactions that take place today involve homes that never made it the MLS. Those transactions are brokered between the top 10% of agents mentioned earlier. In addition to getting you access to more listings, a top agent can provide other resources like vendor referrals for movers, painters, contractors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Can you click with their personality?&lt;/strong&gt; Over the course of the transaction, agents and clients tend to form an intimate relationship. We’re helping you build your dream of moving into your new home, so of course you’d want to work with someone you actually enjoyed working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in need of an agent to represent you during your next home purchase, we’d be delighted to interview for the opportunity to help you find your dream home, so feel free to reach out us. We’ll be right here, ready to help you create a better life through real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dont Forget These Home Buying Costs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH50JJ66b88?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying a home, it’s sometimes easy to forget about certain other costs that come with it. Here are five such costs that you need to remember to budget for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a homebuyer, here are five costs that often get forgotten about that you need to remember to budget for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The down payment.&lt;/strong&gt; Most people don’t actually forget the down payment, but they forget about what kind of difference how much you put down makes. In our area, you can put down as little as 3% for any property up to $700,000. Above that price, you usually have to put down a minimum of 10%. To get the best interest rate from your lender, you’ll have to put down 20% or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Your financial reserves.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll need at least six months’ worth of mortgage payments and property tax payments saved up when you buy a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Moving expenses.&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you’re doing it all yourself (which I don’t recommend), moving isn’t cheap. A good moving company usually costs between $2,500 and $4,000, and we can refer you to several movers who will take great care of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=UNLESS YOU’RE DOING IT ALL YOURSELF, MOVING ISN’T CHEAP.%20http://localhost:4000/dont-forget-these-home-buying-costs.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“UNLESS YOU’RE DOING IT ALL YOURSELF, MOVING ISN’T CHEAP.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Furniture.&lt;/strong&gt; Buying a new home is exciting, and once you move in, odds are you’ll want to fix it up exactly the way you want it. This usually means buying new furniture. Also, don’t forget about the essential items you might need to buy, like a new broom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Home updates.&lt;/strong&gt; If your new home has an old bathroom that you want to fix up, you’ll have to budget for that. How much this will cost you can vary, so we’d be happy to come to your home, give you an estimate, and recommend some excellent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about these costs or you have any other real estate needs, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Sell Your Home for 18% More Money Part 5: Negotiations</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFhH9wsQ_uI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s fifth and final installment into our latest series, we’ll be discussing the last component of earning more money for your home: Negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Considering Buying? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconvalleyrealestatesearch.com/?utm_source=BLOG&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Video+Blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here for gateway access to MLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=HAVING A SKILLED NEGOTIATOR WHO CAN THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR YOU IN ANY REAL ESTATE SCENARIO.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-sell-your-home-for-18-more-money.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“HAVING A SKILLED NEGOTIATOR WHO CAN THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR YOU IN ANY REAL ESTATE SCENARIO.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four strategies that I recommend all sellers employ when it comes time to negotiate a deal for their home sale. These strategies are the last piece of the puzzle in earning 18% more for your property when it comes time to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Encourage preemptive offers.&lt;/strong&gt; This strategy entails capturing interested buyers before your home technically hits the multiple listing service by marketing it as “coming soon.” Typically, it’s advisable to put a list price that’s higher than your expectation at this point in the process. I can tell you from experience that because of our low inventory, buyers are tired of getting beaten out and will be willing submit a preemptive offer that is at or above your price expectation when you follow this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Price for multiple offers.&lt;/strong&gt; If you didn’t earn the price you’d hoped for during the “coming soon” phase of your listing process, it’s time to price your home in a way that represents a great value and encourages multiple offers. When buyers see your listing as an exceptional deal, they will be more likely to compete over it. This will ultimately drive up the price and help you net more for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Determine your best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA).&lt;/strong&gt; More simply put, this strategy essentially serves as the “Plan B” you should fall onto in the event that your original negotiated agreement is somehow compromised. This will ensure that if anything unexpected happens during the course of the deal, you will still have an idea of how you’d like to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Be creative.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re close to getting the results you want but just aren’t there yet, you should consult with your agent about possible solutions. As an example, we had a seller recently whose minimum bottom line for their home was $1 million, but whose buyer had a loan approval that was maxed out at $990,000. To compensate for this $10,000 disparity, we advised the seller to credit the buyer with $5,000, with the understanding that the credit was to be explicitly dedicated toward lowering the buyer’s interest rate on their loan. The buyer was able to lower their interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which raised their mortgage approval up to just over $1 million. As a result, the buyer was able to secure the home and the seller was able to net their desired price. Having a skilled negotiator who can think outside the box will be very helpful for you in any real estate scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the bottom line is that doing many little things right throughout a transaction can make a big difference in your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the right financing is essential to winning a multiple offer situation, and today we’ll discuss three pieces of advice related to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s market is extremely competitive for buyers. So when they’re up against multiple bids from other buyers on the same house, what can they do to make their offer stand out? Today’s topic marks the first installment of my series that addresses that very conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team’s preferred lender, Michael Treon, is going to help me cover the answer to this. Let’s kick off our discussion with three things buyers should do to set themselves up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Get fully approved.&lt;/strong&gt; Winning in a multiple offer situation starts with getting the right financing in place. Getting fully approved and underwritten, not just pre-approved, is essential. A full approval will allow you to be competitive in the marketplace because it eliminates the need for you to include a loan contingency on your offers. Today’s sellers are looking for the cleanest possible offers because they want to close quickly and without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WINNING IN A MULTIPLE OFFER SITUATION STARTS WITH GETTING THE RIGHT FINANCING IN PLACE.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-win-multiple-offer-situation.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WINNING IN A MULTIPLE OFFER SITUATION STARTS WITH GETTING THE RIGHT FINANCING IN PLACE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Select a lender who can provide financing the performs like cash in the market.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 30% of buyers in today’s market are submitting all-cash offers. These offers easily win out against those with conventional loan financing because they allow a shorter close of escrow. Therefore, it’s very important that the offer you submit can stack up against ones such as this. Michael Treon and his team are able to provide buyers with financing that allows for an exceptionally fast close of just 17 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Consider all loan options.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t limit yourself by looking exclusively at 30-year fixed mortgages. The reality is that most homeowners won’t stay in a property for the full 30 years, so it’s critical to consider alternative loan options. There are a lot of opportunities to secure a home with a loan product that makes sense for your personal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand how the right financing can boost your success in multiple offer situations, be on the lookout for part two of our series. Next time, we’ll talk about how to access off-market properties, and how doing so can help you find a home in today’s competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Another Way to Net Up to 18% More for Your Home</title>

&lt;p&gt;Marketing is a key step to net up to 18% more for your home. Today I’d like to go over four areas of marketing you must focus on to optimize your results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m back with the fourth installment into our series on how you can sell your home for 18% more money. I know this sounds like a bold claim, but it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous episodes we talked about preparing, presenting, and pricing your home. This time we’ll be talking about the importance of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing controls how many people see the home, both online and in person, and this exposure is what will dictate what the property sells for. To achieve optimal results, there are four main areas of marketing you must focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Local marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; This involves placing your property on the local MLS, which is syndicated to over 200 different websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=MARKETING CONTROLS HOW MANY PEOPLE SEE THE HOME, BOTH ONLINE AND IN PERSON, AND THIS EXPOSURE IS WHAT WILL DICTATE WHAT THE PROPERTY SELLS FOR.%20http://localhost:4000/another-way-to-earn-more-for-your.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“MARKETING CONTROLS HOW MANY PEOPLE SEE THE HOME, BOTH ONLINE AND IN PERSON, AND THIS EXPOSURE IS WHAT WILL DICTATE WHAT THE PROPERTY SELLS FOR.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. National marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; Silicon Valley is a major relocation destination, so marketing your listing across the country could help you capture an out-of-state buyer. Websites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com will be some of your best resources in gaining national exposure. Our team allocates a lot of our marketing expenses into making sure our clients’ listings appear at the top of online searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. International marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; 31% of all property purchases in our state are either foreign or foreign-born. Therefore, it’s important not to miss out on this segment of the market. Our team has partnered with Proxio, a platform that allows us to connect and engage with over 100 different countries using 82 different websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Social media marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; The internet is an incredible tool. In fact, Facebook could bring you nearly twice the exposure you’d get on Zillow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Move Up In a Tight Housing Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TtUlK0wHK0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we help move-up buyers in today’s market? Here are a few solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that we’ve been hearing the most lately in our market is, “How do I make a move up in a low-inventory market like this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people would prefer to buy a home before selling, but most people can’t afford two mortgages at once.&lt;/strong&gt; That puts the seller in a position where they need to sell first, but they aren’t comfortable selling with what’s out there for them to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friend Shane Valente of Kal Financial is here today to talk about two major things that he can help you accomplish if you have a similar dilemma. These scenarios will allow you to get into a home without having to sell first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One option is using the current equity for your home as a down payment through bridge financing.&lt;/strong&gt; This way, you won’t have to qualify for two mortgages. You’ll be able to buy your new home first, then sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE HAVE A LIST OF OVER 300 OFF-MARKET PROPERTIES THAT AREN’T ON THE MLS.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-make-move-up-in-our-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WE HAVE A LIST OF OVER 300 OFF-MARKET PROPERTIES THAT AREN’T ON THE MLS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one problem solved. Now, what should homebuyers do about the lack of inventory on the market? There are currently only 700 homes on the market in Santa Clara County. This is the lowest level of inventory we’ve seen in 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve been diligently working to address this problem and we’ve been building a list of off-market properties,&lt;/strong&gt; working with builders, flippers, and other agents to fill it up. This list currently has over 300 homes on it that don’t appear on the MLS or other online searches. If you find a property that’s not on the MLS, you can avoid having to participate in a bidding war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to learn more about bridge financing and how it can help you, give Shane a call at (408) 320-0876. If you have any other questions for our team or want to learn more about how we can help you accomplish your real estate goals, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How a Pre-Appraisal Can Net You Up To 8% More When Selling</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you sell your home for up to 18% more money? It sounds like a bold claim, but I’ll prove to you that we can do it for you by walking you through the third part of our five-part process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we talked about presenting your home to market and how we showcase your home using photo, video, and other cool technologies like Matterport. Once the home has been prepared and we’ve presented it to market, it’s now all about pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing is as much of an art as it is a science, and its extremely critical when it comes to getting the most money when selling your home. One of the strategies we like to use here at Brett Jennings Real Estate Experts is getting an appraisal done on the property. &lt;strong&gt;We find that if we use a professional appraiser, we can give that appraiser quote guidance to get us the most favorable value for your home.&lt;/strong&gt; We can also use that appraisal to influence buyers to pay top dollar for your home. Here’s how that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, take the home we sold at Mountain View (pictured at 1:24 in the video). We first asked the local experts in the neighborhood who’d sold more homes in that particular zip code what they thought the value of this property would sell for when we brought it to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent said that it was worth about $1.35 million. We then got our appraiser to give us a generous appraisal on the property, which came in at about $1.42 million. After that, we priced the property at around $1.299 million less than the agent’s survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=PRICING IS AS MUCH OF AN ART AS IT IS A SCIENCE.%20http://localhost:4000/selling-your-home-for-up-to-18-more.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“PRICING IS AS MUCH OF AN ART AS IT IS A SCIENCE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we included a copy of the appraisal in the disclosure package and on the agent comments on the MLS. We set a deadline of 10 days, because one weekend might not be enough to maximize the exposure for buyers. &lt;strong&gt;Also, by setting a deadline, we effectively forced buyers to compete.&lt;/strong&gt; We ended up with seven offers, ranging from about $1.35 million up to $1.43 million, which was $10,000 over our appraised value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We negotiated the top two offers against one another, eventually getting them up to $1.465 million. &lt;strong&gt;We actually got $115,000, or 8% more, in the sale of this home by using an appraisal strategically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that this works is that when buyers are faced with competition in a low-inventory market like ours, they’ll ask their agents what they need to offer in order to get the house. The agent, in most instances, has a printout from the MLS showing home values in that neighborhood; it could be a $150,000 swing in our favor. It really becomes a conversation about what the buyers are comfortable offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found by having a pre-appraisal in our disclosure package, the agent is also going to reference the appraisal when consulting the buyers, advising them to offer at least the appraised value. &lt;strong&gt;Doing just that, we’ve gotten as much as 8% more than the average market value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about pricing, using an appraisal strategically, or selling your home, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to tell you more about our winning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to part two of my series about how to sell your home for up to 18% more money. I know that sounds like a bold claim, but we’ll prove it’s possible by walking you through our process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we talked about preparing the home for sale. Once it’s prepared, it’s now about presenting your home to the market. How do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=BY USING THESE TECHNIQUES TO PRESENT YOUR HOME TO MARKET, WE CAN GET 200% TO 300% MORE BUYERS TO SEE YOUR HOME, WHICH ULTIMATELY DRIVES UP THE PRICE.%20http://localhost:4000/selling-your-home-for-up-to-18-more.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“BY USING THESE TECHNIQUES TO PRESENT YOUR HOME TO MARKET, WE CAN GET 200% TO 300% MORE BUYERS TO SEE YOUR HOME, WHICH ULTIMATELY DRIVES UP THE PRICE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is stage the home. If you have nice furniture, we might leave most or all of it in the home to show. Otherwise, we’ll bring in furniture that will showcase the home to look amazing online. We know that how your home shows online is the new curb appeal, that &lt;strong&gt;staged homes will sell for 2% to 3% more money,&lt;/strong&gt; and that 95% of staged homes will sell within 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, once we’ve staged the home, we want to capture it in photo and video. Specifically, we want to use twilight photography to showcase your home. Why? Well, our marketing statistics show that photographing in twilight will not only make the home show well in nice lighting, but also that most other homes online aren’t doing twilight photography. &lt;strong&gt;We found that we get 200% to 300% more clicks using twilight photos than daylight photos.&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, the price you get for your home is going to be a function of how many people see it online and click through the photos. That will determine how many offers you get down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also want to capture your home on video, which provides a perspective that still photos can’t provide. &lt;strong&gt;Video is the most frequently used medium with consumers on mobile devices.&lt;/strong&gt; 70% of people are watching videos on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, video enables us to nearly double your exposure by getting into one of the best marketing mediums—Facebook. We get thousands, if not tens of thousands, of views of our Facebook videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last thing we do is capture the home using a technology called &lt;strong&gt;Matterport.&lt;/strong&gt; This is effectively like a Google Streetview for you home, and you can view anywhere in and around the home, looking both up and down. &lt;strong&gt;Viewers can get a sense of what it’s like to be inside that home. It’s the next best thing to being there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Matterport’s newest technology, they even incorporate virtual reality. If someone has Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, they can take their iPhone and see the home in 3-D as if they were walking through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using these techniques to present your home to market, we can get 200% to 300% more buyers to see your home, which ultimately drives up the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, feel free to give me a call. We’ll be right here, ready to help you create a better life through real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

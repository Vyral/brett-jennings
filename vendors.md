<p>Today I’m excited to be joined by Andrew Gonzales from Genesis Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning for the chance to talk about what people should look for in a quality carpet cleaning company.</p>

<p>Andrew started Genesis back in 2003 as a family-owned business. Because of this, he knows exactly who he is working with and can trust that the job is being done well. <strong>Everyone there is invested in the quality of their work.</strong></p>

<p>Genesis believes in using the best technology available. They use a truck-mounted system that’s actually a car engine that’s able to heat the water up to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. They also use an RX-20—a deep cleaning machine that scrubs carpet at 360 revolutions per minute and has such a strong vacuum power that it can pull even sand out of carpets. Right now, Genesis has 195 reviews on Yelp—95% of which are five stars. <strong>Andrew and his team worked hard to get such positive feedback because they truly care about doing the best job for their customers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scott Cramer from Ace Relocation joins us to discuss three things to look for when selecting a moving company.</strong></p>
<ol class="indent">
<li><strong>Pay attention to the mover's reputation.</strong> Do your research. Read customer reviews, and make sure everyone that you allow into your home is on the up and up.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the company has workers' compensation insurance.</strong> This ensures that if someone gets injured on the job, the company will not sue the homeowners.</li>
<li><strong>The mover should care.</strong> You want them to care for the home and the goods they are moving.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>With Ace Relocation, the home itself will be protected by rug and hardwood floor covers, and everything will be wrapped appropriately.</strong> Anything that's breakable will be covered first with cardboard, then pad-wrapped, and then shrink-wrapped. That's why we recommend Scott Cramer and Ace Relocation to all of our clients. Ace Relocation is a great moving company.
